## Computer Architecture Lab 计算机体系结构实验 (COMP130013.01)

This is our semester-long lab for our Computer Architecture course. In this project, we are asked to implement a MIPS CPU with System Verilog. 

Our lab is divided into three stages: Single Cycle MIPS CPU, Pipelined MIPS CPU, Pipelined MIPS CPU with cache. You can access my code for each stage in the "[Release](https://github.com/jasha64/MIPS_Pipeline_with_Cache/releases)" page and my reports in the "[report](https://github.com/jasha64/MIPS_Pipeline_with_Cache/tree/master/report)" folder.
